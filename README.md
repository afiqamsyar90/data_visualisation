“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device.” — John Tukey

Visualisation is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data.
A good visualisation might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data.
Visualisations can surprise you, but don’t scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them.
